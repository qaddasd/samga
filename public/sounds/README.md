# Notification Sounds

Place notification sound files here.

For the complete functionality, you need:

1. Create a file named `notification.mp3` in this folder
2. The sound file should be a short (1-3 seconds) notification sound
3. The sound should be a standard MP3 format

For example, you can download a notification sound from:
- https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
- https://freesound.org/
- https://orangefreesounds.com/notification-sounds/

The system will automatically use this sound when new notifications arrive.
